#### Data Exploration: 
Various exploratory data analysis techniques were employed to gain a better understanding of the dataset. This involved examining the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, and performing basic statistical calculations.

#### Dashboard Design: 
The visualizations were designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing viewers to explore the data and gain insights easily. Careful consideration was given to the choice of charts, colors, and layout to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the dashboards.

#### Interactivity and Filters:
Interactive features, such as filters and parameters, were incorporated to enable users to customize their analysis based on specific criteria. This enhances the flexibility and usability of the dashboards.

#### Insights and Interpretations:
